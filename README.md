# CS-MIO
Compressive-sensing assisted mixed-integer optimization (CS-MIO) is a solver for data driven discovery of dynamical system from highly noisy data.

## Source Code
This contains the Python source code for discovering the exact governing equations from highly noisy data.

## Example
### Lorenz3 system
Suppose we have measurements of the position of a Lorenz3 system obeying the following dynamical equations:
